Mail client I wrote in the 1990s.  Needs some Perl libraries to
function.  I'm not massively interested in getting it working again.

*** 

Mash, the Ampata release.

Setup: I have the perl files in ~/src/mash, which a symlink from ~/bin/mash to
~/src/mash/mash.pl, and a ~/.mashrc copied from mashrc.  mash can figure out
where the rest of the required files live, so you can place the package
elsewhere, but all the files do need to be together, unless you modify @INC.

And you'll want to modify the obvious variables in .mashrc (possibly including
Sendmail), plus search for 'damien' in the other files.  I don't have any
installation procedure yet.

mbox format is used, plus dot-locking, making it a natural with procmail.
